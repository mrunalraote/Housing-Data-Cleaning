INTRODUCTION\n","The objective of this analysis is to examine the Housing dataset,\n","identify missing values, apply appropriate data cleaning techniques,\n","and validate the dataset after preprocessing.\n","\n","2. DATASET OVERVIEW\n","Dataset Name: Housing.csv\n","Total Rows: 21,613\n","Total Columns: 21\n","The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features related\n","to house prices and property characteristics.\n","\n","3. MISSING VALUE ANALYSIS\n","Missing values were identified using the isnull().sum() method.\n","After analysis, it was observed that there are no missing values\n","present in any column of the dataset.\n","\n","4. MISSING VALUE VISUALIZATION\n","A bar chart was implemented using matplotlib to visualize missing values.\n","Since the dataset does not contain missing values, no bars appeared\n","in the chart. The visualization code was included for demonstration\n","purposes and future use on datasets with missing values.\n","\n","5. DATA CLEANING METHODS\n","Although no missing values were found, standard data cleaning\n","techniques were implemented:\n","- Numerical columns were prepared for median imputation.\n","- Categorical columns were prepared for mode imputation.\n","- Columns with more than 40% missing values were set to be removed,\n","  but no columns met this condition.\n","\n","6. DATA VALIDATION\n","After preprocessing, the dataset was rechecked for missing values\n","and validated to ensure data consistency and completeness.\n","\n","7.
